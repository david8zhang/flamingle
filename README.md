Countries - the countries on the map. Countries have a name

Country_cods - a join table between countries and causes of death in order to create many to many relationships between countries and diseases

Donations - the donations to different charities. Donations have a user_id, charity_id

User_charities - a join table between users and charities in order to create many to many relationships between users and charities
